# Number format

Numbers occupy a place in memory with a certain size and arrangement for their bytes. Of course, all numbers exist as one or more bytes when saved in memory.

**Digital numbers**

The data stored in memory is just a lot of electronic connections in the circuits of the @boardname@. A number is the most basic type of data and other types of data are made using numbers (a number is used to act as a text character in memory). Now a number is made by combination of on and off connections. One connection is called a _bit_ and this is used as a single digit for computer numbers. A single bit can mean one of two numbers, 0 or 1. Two bits can mean one of four numbers, 00, 01, 10, or 11. We use decimal numbers normally so we give the decimal names to the computer numbers. So, for the two bit numbers, their decimal names are: 00 = 0, 01 = 1, 10 = 2, and 11 = 3.

**Byte**

Now, the smallest number normally used in computers is a combination of 8 bits called a _byte_.
