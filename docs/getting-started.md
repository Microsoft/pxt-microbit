Here are some challenges for you. Arrange the blocks in the editor
to make real programs that work!

## ~

Use the **Basic** drawer in the editor
to drag out and arrange three blocks to create this program:

```blocks
basic.forever(() => {
    basic.showLeds(`
        . . . . .
        . # . # .
        . . . . .
        # . . . #
        . # # # .
        `)
    basic.showLeds(`
        . . . . .
        . . . . .
        . . . . .
        . . . . .
        . . . . .
        `)
});
```

When this program runs, you will see a smiley face, then a blank
screen, then a smiley again -- it never stops! (That's because of the
`[basic.forever(() => {})]` block.)
