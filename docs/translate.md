# Help translate

Our translations are managed via Crowdin, a translation management platform. It is free to join
and you can volunteer to translate parts of the web site.

## Translating the editor interface

The project below contains the resources from https://www.pxt.io and the menu items of https://codethemicrobit.com.

* [https://crowdin.com/project/kindscript](https://crowdin.com/project/kindscript)

You will find two files in that project:

* ``string.json``: text contained in the menu items of https://codethemicrobit.com
* ``website.json``: text contained in the pages served by https://www.pxt.io 

## Translating the blocks and reference documentation

You will find package files under ``/microbit`` , one for the block definition and one for the descriptions:

* ``core-strings.json``: contains the block definitions
* ``core-jsdoc-strings.json``: contains the descriptions

The block definition should be carefully translated using the [block definition syntax](https://www.pxt.io/defining-blocks).
