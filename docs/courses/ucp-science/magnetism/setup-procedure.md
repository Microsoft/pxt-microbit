## Code

This project will use two @boardname@s to collect and record data using the Windows 10 MakeCode app as described in **Data Collection**.

## Data Collection

There are several ways to collect data from an experiment. The simplest is having the data display on the LED screen and manually record the data on a paper. Data can also be collected using the Windowâ€™s 10 MakeCode app. The third way is using 2 @boardname@s with one observing the data and then radioing the results to a second @boardname@ can allow the remote collection of data.
