# Overview

## Science Concept

### Magnetic Force and Magnetic Field

The force that a magnet exerts on certain materials, including other magnets, is called magnetic force. This force is similar to the electric force because the particles do not have to touch. A magnet can exert force over a distance because it is surrounded by a magnetic field. In the figure below, you can see the magnetic field surrounding a bar magnet. Tiny bits of iron, called iron filings, were placed on a sheet of paper. When a magnet was placed under the paper, it attracted the iron filings. The pattern of the iron filings shows the lines of force that make up the magnetic field of the magnet. The concentration of iron filings near the poles (the ends) indicates that these areas exert the strongest force ([ck12.org - Magnets](https://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Physical-Science-Concepts-For-Middle-School/section/5.78/)).

## Project Goal

Give students real world experience with coding, collecting data, analyzing data, and reporting results using [MakeCodeâ€™s](https://makecode.com) block programming and a [micro:bit](http://microbit.org) with its sensors.

## Prior Knowledge

Students need to have a basic knowledge of how to code using block style programming (micro:bit using the Windows 10 MakeCode app) and download a program to a @boardname@.

## Student Outcomes

Students will:

* Create a compass on a @boardname@ using the magnetism sensor.
* Create experiments to collect data using @boardname@s and the magnetism sensor. 
* Setup different experiments to observe the magnetism effect.
* Code the @boardname@s to collect data remotely over the @boardname@ radios.
* Analyze the data collected.
  
## Materials Needed

* 1 @boardname@ with battery connected
* A longer USB @boardname@ cable
* Magnets, battery, copper wire, and nails
* Spreadsheet for data analysis
* Metal for metal detector
