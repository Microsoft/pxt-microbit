# Writing Code

## ~ avatar

The syntax of JavaScript may seem daunting at first, but we've got help to get you over it.

## ~

Programming languages are quite picky with the syntax, a single character can prevent your program to work! Let's review a few tools available in MakeCode to make your coding experience better.

## JavaScript toolbox

Just like the blocks toolbox, you can drag and drop snippets of JavaScript. It's a great way to discover how the syntax works.

## Suggestions and auto-completion

When you start typing, you will quickly notice a menu of suggestion poping up right under the cursor. The editor is giving possible snippets of code based on what you've just written (This is something that professional developer use every day!).

When you see the option you were trying to type, press **Enter** to insert it... rather than typing it entirely.

## Pairing brackets

Brackets and parenthesis always come in pairs, an opener and a closer. However, with so many brackets and parenthesis, it is can be challenging to match both.

**Place your cursor on a bracket or parenthesis** and the editor will highlight the pair!

## Indentation lines

Once you have many nested loops and if statements, it can be challenging to see which "level"
you are in.

Check the **indentation lines** to find your way back.

## Error squiggles

When the editor detects a syntax error, it puts red squiggles where it thinks the error is.

Place your mouse over the squiggle to get a detailled error message.

### ~ hint

Pro tip: always look at the first error and fix that one. All the other ones might be due to that one.

## Auto-formatting

Press ``Shift + Alt + F`` to auto-reformat your code and keep it tidy.
