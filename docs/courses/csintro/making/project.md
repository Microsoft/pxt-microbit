# Project: micro:pet

## Sense Receptors

This project is an opportunity for students to create a micro:pet for the animal they designed to sense and respond to danger. 

##The Problem
Zoologists have just heard about a new animal species on a remote island. They
have very little information about the animal, and they have not yet been able to
determine how the animal senses and responds to danger. They do know that
animals use specialized sense receptors to sense danger and different methods to
respond to danger. One example of how animals respond to danger are squids squirt ink to disorient the predator. 

##Your Challenge

Build a micro:pet that:
* Has a way of sensing and responding to danger
* Supports the micro:bit and its battery pack
* Allows you to easily access the micro:bit to turn it on and off

Your design should use whatever materials are available to support the micro:bit so that its face is showing. You can be creative and decide how to mount the board, and how to decorate your critter.


Some photos of sample micro:pets below!

## Ideas for Mods

* Find a way to make part of the animal move.
* Give your animal a natural habitat.
* Create a way to carry your animal.
* Create an animal that reacts when you pet it or move it (find a way to detect when the micro:bit is moved or when its position changes in a certain way.)

## Reflection
* Describe a difficult point in the process of designing the micro:pet, and explain how you resolved it.
