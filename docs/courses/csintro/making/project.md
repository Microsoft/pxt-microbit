# Project: micro:pet

## Sense Receptors

This project is an opportunity for students to create a micro:pet for the animal they designed to sense and respond to danger. 

## The Problem
Zoologists have just discovered a new species! They
have very little time to observe the animal, and they have not yet been able to
determine how the animal hunts or senses and responds to danger. You just learned that animals use specialized sense receptors to sense danger and respond to danger. Can you think of an animal and its response? 

## Your Challenge

Build a micro:pet that:
* Has a way of sensing and responding to danger
* Supports the micro:bit and its battery pack
* Allows you to easily access the micro:bit to turn it on and off

Your design should use whatever materials are available to support the micro:bit so that its face is showing. You can be creative and decide how to mount the board, and how to decorate your critter.


Some photos of sample micro:pets below!


## Reflection
* Describe a difficult point in the process of designing the micro:pet, and explain how you resolved it.
