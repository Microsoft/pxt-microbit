## Duct tape sheet

Let's start by building a duct tape sheet.

Position the paper sheet on the workbench and place lines of tape over it. Make sure to overlap each layer to avoid seeing gaps of papers. In case of mistake, add tape!

Cover the entire paper sheet with tape. Don't hesitate to use various colors or patterns!

Unstick the sheet from the workbench carefully to avoid ripping out the tape and turn it over.

Fold the remaining tape sections on the sides towards the center.

## Card Hole

We need to cut a hole in the center of the sheet to allow storage of coins and cards inside the wallet.


Gently fold the sheet in half.

Gently foldy the other way.

Place the duct tape roll on the inside corner. This will determine the size of the hole.

Use your marker and trace around the roll.

Use your scissors and cut along the line you've just traced while keeping the sheet folded.
