### ~ hint

This activity involves opening an electronic toy, cutting into cables and potentially rendering it completly useless.

## Materials

* Toy RC car with 4 or 6 AA batteries
* 1 @boardname@
* a cable trimmer
* small Philips screw driver
* [1 Kitronik motor driver](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5620-motor-driver-board-for-the-bbc-microbit-v2.html)

## What's the plan?

Most toy RC car use 3 small DC motors to operate:
* 1 DC motor for the back wheels torque,
* 1 DC motor for the front wheels torque,
* 1 DC motor to steer the front wheels

The plan is to open up the RC car, remove the existing electronic controller and replace it with the motor driver
that can control 2 DC motors. We will connect both torque motors to one controller and the steering motor to the other controller.

Once the motor driver is connected, we will use a @boardname@ to control it. Another @boardname@ can also be used as a radio controller
for the @boardname@ in the car.

### ~ hint

Ask friends and family for old RC cars lying around, scout thrift shops and other second hand shops for discarded RC cars.
