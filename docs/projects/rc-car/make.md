## Step 1: Remove the batteries!

Make sure all the batteries are removed from the toy car!

## Step 2: Remove the cover

Remove the various protective covers until you have access to the electronic controller. Make sure to keep track of all the screws you remove, 
you will need them again!

## Step 3: Cut out the electronic board

Follow the motor and power cables and cut the wires as close as possible from the electronic board. You should end up with a total of 8 cables:
2 for power, 2 for the steering motor and 2 pairs for the torque motors.

## Step 4: Prepare the cables

Using the wire trimmer, expose 1/4 inch (1/2 cm) of metal on each wire so you can attach it to the motor driver.

## Step 5: Connect the battery cables

* Connect the cables from the battery section to the power input on the motor shield. 
Make sure the **+** cable goes into the **+** port!
* Connect both torque motors to the **motor 1** connector in the motor driver. 
Make sure to connect the cables of same colors so that your wheel turn the same direction!
* Connect the remaining motor cables to the **motor 2** connector.

## Step 6: Slot in the @boardname@

Probably the easiest step, insert the @boardname@ in the edge connector until clips in.

## (Optional) Step 7: Cut out a slot in the cover to fit the @boardname@

Depending on your car size, you may be able to fit back the decoration top back on the car. 
Otherwise, get some cardboard, scissors and a glue gun to rebuild it yourself!

## (Optional) Step 8: Paint job

Once you have replaced the cover (original or carboard), decorate it to your taste!
