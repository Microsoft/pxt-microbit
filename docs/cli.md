# Command Line Interface

```sim
basic.forever(() => {
    basic.showString("CLI<3")
})
```

It is possible to use the tools from a command line interface (CLI). The PXT CLI allows to 
* edit, compile or deploy JavaScript programs
* can easily be integrated in most IDEs. It comes with built-in support for [Visual Studio Code](/code)!
* run a local web server for the web editor
* author packages using JavaScript and/or C++

Using the CLI assumes that you have some experience with programming and will require to install tools on your machine as well.
