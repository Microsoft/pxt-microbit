# WebUSB

WebUSB is an emerging web standard that allows to access USB devices from web pages.
It allows for a **one-click download** without installing any additional app or software! It also allows to receive data from the @boardname@.

## Support

* Chrome 65+ for Android, Chrome OS, Linux, macOS and Windows 10.

## Upgrade your Firmware

Make sure that your @boardname@ is running version **0248** or above of the firmware. Upgrading is as easy as dragging a file and it takes a few seconds to get it done.

[Check out the instructions to check and upgrade your @boardname@.](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000084059-beta-testing-web-usb)

## Pair your device

To get started with WebUSB,

* connect your @boardname@ to your computer with the microUSB cable
* open a script
* open the gearwheel menu and select **Pair device**
* click on the **Pair device** button and select your @boardname@ in the list

## One-click Download

Once your @boardname@ is paired, MakeCode will use WebUSB to transfer the code without having to drag and drop. Happy coding!

## Console output

MakeCode will be able to "listen" to your @boardname@ and display the console output, generated by ``console.log`` for example.
