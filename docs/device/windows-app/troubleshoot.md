# Troubleshooting downloads from the Windows 10 App

Is Windows App not downloading your program properly? Let's try to figure why!

## Step 1: Check your cable

Make sure that your @boardname@ is connected to your computer with a micro USB cable. You should see a **MICROBIT** folder appear in Windows Explorer when it's connected. 

If you can't see the folder:

* Make sure that the USB cable is working. Does the cable work on another computer? If not, find a different cable to use. Some cables may only provide a power connection and don't actually transfer data.

Is the cable good but you still can't see the **MICROBIT** folder? OK, try Step 2.

## Step 2: Check your firmware version

It's possible that the firmware version on the @boardname@ needs an update. Let's check:

1. Go to the **MICROBIT** folder.
2. Open the **DETAILS.TXT** file.
3. Look for a line in the file that says the version number. It should say **Version: \.\.\.**

If the version is **0234**, you **NEED** to update the [firmware](/device/firmware) on your @boardname@. 
Follow the [upgrade instructions](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000019131-how-to-upgrade-the-firmware-on-the-micro-bit) from the **Micro:bit Foundation**.
