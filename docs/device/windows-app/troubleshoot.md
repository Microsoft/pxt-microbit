# Troubleshooting download on Windows 10 App

Windows App not downloading properly? Let's try to fix it out!

## Step 1: check your cable

Make sure that your @boardname@ is connected to your computer via a micro USB cable. You should see a **MICROBIT** drive appear in Explorer. 

If you cannot see the drive,

* check that the USB cable works on another computer. Some cables only provide power cable and no logic cables.


## Step 2: check your firmware version

* go to the **MICROBIT** drive
* open the **DETAILS.TXT** file
* look for the version number, it should say **Version: ...**

**If the version is 0234**, you **need** to update the [firmware](/device/firmware) on your @boardname@.
