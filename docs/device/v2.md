# micro:bit v2

The micro:bit v2 introduces a microphone, speaker and capacitive touch on the logo. The new blocks designed for the micro:bit v2 will not work with the micro:bit v1. 
Let's learn how this works in MakeCode...

## How to recognize the micro:bit v2?

The first thing to know is wether you have a micro:bit v1 or micro:bit v2 at hand. You can recognize the v2 boards visually with these differences...

* notches in the bottom edge connector
* gold plated logo on the front, instead of colored
* large black microphone component centrally located in the back, and rotated by 45deg

## v2 Blocks

The following blocks require the micro:bit v2 hardware to run. If you try a program with those blocks on a micro:bit v1 board, you will get the ``927`` error code sliding on your screen.

```cards
input.onSound(DetectedSound.Loud, function () {})
input.onLogoEvent(TouchButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {})
input.logoIsPressed()
input.soundLevel()
soundExpression.giggle.playUntilDone()
soundExpression.giggle.play()
music.setOnBoardSpeakerEnabled(false)
pins.touchSetMode(TouchTarget.P0, TouchTargetMode.Capacitive)
```

## v2 simulator

If you program uses any of the micro:bit v2 specific blocs, it will automatically turn into a micro:bit v2, with notches and a gold plated logo. You will also see a "v2" button on the lower right of the board.

## I see 927 scrolling on my board?

If you try to use a program with micro:bit v2 blocks on a micro:bit v1 board, you will see the **927** [error code](/device/error-codes) scroll on the micro:bit screen.
