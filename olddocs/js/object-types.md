# Custom object types

Touch Develop docs for the @boardname@.

### What is an object?

An object allows you to bundle several related pieces of data. For instance, if you have a player on the screen, there are two pieces of data that make up the object: its `x` position, and its `y` position. Therefore, we will define a player to be an *object* with two *fields*: the `x` field and the `y` field. By grouping related variables together in a single object, you reduce confusion in your script and eliminate some errors.

### What is an object type?

In order to use objects, we must first define an object type. More concretely, in order to create a new player, we must define what a player *is*. In our case, the type of players is the type of objects with two fields `x` and `y` of type `Number`.

Creating an object type is done in the following manner. Hit "add new", then hit "object type".

You can change the name of the type by clicking on it (i.e. replace `Thing` with `Player`). You can also add two fields of type number. Once this is done, here's what you should see.

We have now defined what a player is (it has an `x` field and a `y` field). `Player` is a type, just like `Number` and `String`. However, we have not created any player yet.

### Creating objects and using them

To create a new *variable* of a given type, you can call the `create` operation on `Player`.

```
let p = new Player()
```

Just like `var x := 3` creates a new variable (`x`) of type `Number`, the line above creates a new variable (`p`) of type `Player`. We say that `p` is an *instance* of `Player`.

If you want to *modify* (mutate) `p`, here's how you do it.

```
p.x = 5
```

You can read the *fields* of `p` as follows.

```
basic.showString("My player is at x = ", 150)
basic.showNumber(p.x, 150)
```

That is, the generic syntax for accessing a field `x` of an object `p` is `p â†’ x`.

If there are multiple players in your game, you may want to create a collection of them.

```
let c = (<Player[]>[])
c.push(new Player())
```

A good example of using objects is in the game pac-man runaway. Search for it, read it and clone it!
