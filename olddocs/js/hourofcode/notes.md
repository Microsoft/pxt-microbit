# Hour of Code notes

learn how to run an Hour Of Code with the @boardname@. #docs

The @boardname@ can be used to run an Hour Of Code™ event for beginner of all ages. This document provides a detailed guidance on how to prepare and deliver the event in your school.

## Preparation

1) Computers

Each participant has **a computer connected to a @boardname@ via micro-USB**.

2) Internet

Ensure that each computer has access to **internet**.

3) Accounts

Create a classroom in https://www.microbit.co.uk and pre-populate the classroom with student accounts. **Print the student passwords** and cut out each password.

4) Print the activity challenges (1 copy per participant):

* [hour of code](/js/hourofcode/challenges)

4) (optional) Raffle tickets and prizes

Reward students with raffle tickets to keep them engaged. Finishing a tutorial or challenge on paper should equal a raffle ticket. Perform a raffle throughout the hour and give away lots of cheap prizes (candy is always a nice choice).

5) (optional) Music

Bring more energy in the room by playing music.

## Timeline

* ``00:00`` student sign in using **printed passwords** (see step 3)
* ``10:00`` [hour of code tutorial](/js/hourofcode)
* ``40:00`` raffle and demoes
* ``50:00`` that's it!

## Follow up

After your Hour Of Code™, you will want to provide plenty of material for students to continue learning about coding. Here are some good places to start:

* [more challenges](/lessonss) are available for @boardname@
* [the Quick Start Guide for Teachers](http://www.slideshare.net/Microsofteduk/bbc-microbit-guide-from-hodder-education) are available within @boardname@

_The Hour of Code™ is a nationwide initiative by [Computer Science Education Week](http://csedweek.org) and [Code.org](http://code.org) to introduce millions of students to one hour of computer science and computer programming._
