# flipping bird quiz answers

use modulo with a conditional.

This is the answer key for the [flipping bird quiz](/lessons/flipping-bird/quiz).

## 1. What does "modulo" mean in math?

<br/>

Modulo (or Mod) is the remainder of a division problem.

## 2. Consider the following code

If the rectangle below represents the @boardname@, shade in the LEDs that show the value being stored into  the **global variable**, `count`. Explain why that particular area is shaded.

```
count = 1
count_ = count_ + 2
```

<br/>

<br/>

The variable `count` is now equal to 3.

<br/>

## 3. Consider the following directions

Modulo (Mod) tells us what the remainder of a division is. For example, `15 mod 4 is 3` since 15 divided by 4 has a remainder of 3.

```
count = 12
count = math.mod(count, 5)
```

If the rectangle below represents the @boardname@, shade in the LEDs that show the value being stored into  the **global variable**, `count`. Explain why that particular area is shaded.

The display will show `2` because the remainder of 12 divided by 5 is 2.
